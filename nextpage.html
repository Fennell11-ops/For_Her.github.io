                <p>My Love,</p>
                <p>As I sit here on the stairs of the hostel with the dusk settling in, I feel the warmth of you. I have been wanting to write something for you for a longtime now
                   So here it, Miss Ankita Mundra i fell for you the day i saw that beautiful eyes of urs and ive been falling for them since the day then. Ive seen you go through a lot of things in Sem 3
                   and I wanted was to be there for you in anyway possible. Being with you through all these months has changed me into a more better person. Everyday when i see you i get this sense of feeling
                   that there's someone whos always going to be by my side no matter what happens. I swear the good morning and making u sleep on call ahhhhh cant describe how it feels, and for some reason 
                   it always feels like we were meant to be forever. I love to take care of you in everyway possible, I just want to be happy. I promise you my baby that this boy right here would never leave you
                   in the dark, he'll be right there always rooting for your succeess. I think i could have written a lot more but i would save that for the future. I LOVE YOU MY QUEEN ANKITA MUNDRA.
                   </p>
                <p>Forever your ALARM CLOCK❤️</p>
